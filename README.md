This was accomplished by:

-series of prompts provided including:
    -password length between 8-128
    -must include at least 1 uppercase?
    -must include at least 1 lowercase?
    -must include at least 1 number?
    -must include at least 1 special character?

-prompt responses are validated

-at least 1 of each selected type is randomly selected

-order is shuffled to prevent 1st character being the 1st type selected, 2nd character type being the 2nd type selected, etc. to make truly random

-generated password is displayed to the page
